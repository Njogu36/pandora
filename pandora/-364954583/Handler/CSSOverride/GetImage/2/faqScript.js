                answer: "<p>Unfortunately, Microsoft Word is not a print ready format. <br/>More modern versions of Microsoft Word can save files as PDF, that is okay to send to us. To save as a PDF, click 'file', and then 'save as', and select 'PDF' as the format, instead of '.doc'. If there is no option on your Word version, there is an online tool that will convert your Word file for free, zamzar.com. Please, check the converted file carefully as elements of your design may move or change.</p>",

                question: "What is bleed? And why is it important?",
                answer: "<p>Bleed is the area between the trim marks and the rest of the paper. This area should have continued colour or design from your artwork. They will be cut off from your document but it guarantees there will be no unprinted edges in the final trimmed document. Bleed marks are usually 3mm.</p>",

                question: "What is safe margin?",
                answer: "<p>Safe margin is the space between the text and graphics and the trim mark. You must not add relevant information in this area as it can be slightly trimmed. That's why it's called safe margin, keep your design inside of it and you will be fine.</p>",

RGB and Pantone artworks will be converted to CMYK and this could affect your final colours. <br/>If you'd like to print with white ink, we have created an easy-to-follow video guide explaining how to get your file ready to print with white ink - <a href='/blog/27/order-business-cards-printed-with-white-ink-find-out-how-in-our-video'>check it out.</a></p>",

                answer: "<p>Colour on your screen and on a printed page may look different. The reason is that screens are backlit while paper reflects colour. If the tone of the colour is critical, contact us and we'll do our best to get the result you want.</p>",

                question: "What does your artwork proofing check include?",

                question: "Can I use any font?",
                answer: "<p>Yes, as long as it's embedded (outlined) on the document. <br/>If you are using Illustrator or InDesign, highlight the text, select 'type' in the top menu and choose 'create outlines'. <br/> In Microsoft Word, click the 'options' tab. Once that's open, switch over to the 'save' tab. Select 'embed fonts in the file' and click 'ok', then resave your file.</p>",

                answer: "<p>It's very likely this isn't possible. Because items are printed at different times, by different machines and different humans, it might mean one order is completed in the morning and shipped and the other in the afternoon, for example. We like to catch these type of issues and post everything together but sometimes they slip the net and get sent separately. We also want to make sure your delivery arrives in perfect condition, and sometimes grouping packages may cause the parcel to become unbalanced, or awkwardly shaped for our courier to process and may result in unwanted damage or delay.</p>",
